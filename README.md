Neural network methods for anomaly detection in time series.
In this work, 3 neural nets methods were explored:
- Boostrap Method
- Lower-Upper bound estimation (LUBE)
- LSTM Reconstruction error method
Please refer to the report for more information.

The implementation for the best resulting method (Bootstrap) was made public in this repo.

*Requirements:*
- Python 3.x
- Pytorch
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
